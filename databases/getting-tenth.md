# Brief Introduction


Opening with a teenaged Boruto Uzumaki facing a teenaged Kawaki in the ruins of Konoha, the former recounts his story.[3] The son of Seventh Hokage Naruto Uzumaki, Boruto feels angry over his father placing the village before his family. At that time, Boruto becomes a member of a ninja team led by Naruto's protégé Konohamaru Sarutobi, alongside Sarada Uchiha, the daughter of Sasuke and Sakura Uchiha, and Mitsuki, Orochimaru's artificial son. Sasuke returns to the village to warn Naruto of an impending threat relating to deduce the motivations of Kaguya Ōtsutsuki. Boruto asks Sasuke to train him for the upcoming Chunin exam to impress his father. During the exam, Momoshiki and Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki, the duo whom Sasuke met, abduct Naruto so they can use Kurama, a tailed beast sealed inside his body, to revitalize the dying Divine Tree from the dimension they came from. Boruto, Sasuke and the four Kages, the leaders of other ninja villages, set out to rescue Naruto. The battle ends when Momoshiki, sacrificing Kinshiki to increase his own strength, is defeated by Boruto and Naruto with Sasuke's help; Momoshiki survives long enough to realize Boruto's full potential while warning him of future tribulations and giving him a mysterious mark called "Karma". After recovering from his fight, Boruto decides to become like Sasuke in the future, while entrusting Sarada to follow her dream of becoming the next Hokage.

Naruto and the other learn there is a group called "Kara" searching for people with the marks called Karma. Boruto's team meets Kara's fugitive Kawaki, a boy who also has Karma. Kawaki becomes an adopted member of the Uzumaki family to protect him. However, when trying to protect Kawaki, Naruto and Sasuke are defeated by the leader of Kara, Jigen, who seals Naruto away while Sasuke escapes. Team 7 saves Naruto when Boruto's Karma causes him to be possessed by Momoshiki. After learning of this, Sasuke discovers all Karma users will be taken over by the Otsutsuki clan, including Jigen and Boruto. Meanwhile, a mutiny starts to form in Kara, with Koji Kashin challenging Jigen, while Amado goes to Konoha to seek asylum in exchange for information, revealing the real leader of Kara as Isshiki, who has been possessing Jigen ever since he was betrayed by Kaguya when they came to Earth millennia ago, and that Karma allows the Otsutsuki clan to resurrect via the host's body. Although Koji kills Jigen, forcing Isshiki to reincarnate imperfectly while Kawaki's Karma is removed in the process, Isshiki forces Koji to retreat and leaves to attack Konoha.

At Konoha, Isshiki attempts to find Kawaki, but Naruto faces him head-on, preparing to fight. Boruto transports himself and Isshiki to another dimension away from the village, with Sasuke and Naruto following. Since Boruto is Momoshiki's vessel, Isshiki plans to feed him to his Ten Tails in order to plant a Divine Tree. With Naruto's new power, the Baryon Mode, he kills Isshiki, but at the cost of Kurama's life. Boruto, possessed by Momoshiki, stabs and destroys Sasuke's Rinnegan. However, Sasuke and Kawaki face Momoshiki until Boruto recovers his body. After being defeated, Isshiki requests Code, who was guarding the Ten-Tails, to carry on the Otsutsuki's will by sacrificing either Boruto or Kawaki and becoming Ōtsutsuki himself. Code vows to avenge Isshiki, and proceeds to release two of the strongest cyborgs created by Amado that was supposed to have been disposed off, Eida and Daemon. The female cyborg Eida agrees to help Code kill Naruto if he in turn spares Kawaki for her to have a normal romance with, because her powers of seduction hinders her from experiencing proper love except with Otsutsuki.

Amado gives Kawaki a weaponized version of Isshiki's Karma, which he uses to assist Boruto in fighing Code. However, Momoshiki takes over Boruto's body, forcing Kawaki to kill him on Boruto's orders. However, Momoshiki revives Boruto as an Otsutsuki, at the cost of his own reincarnation. Both Eida and Daemon are revealed to have been reprogrammed by Amado, and turn on Code, forcing him to flee. In the aftermath, Amado reveals that Eida's and Daemon's powers are shinjutsu transplanted from the corpse of Shibai Otsutsuki, an Otsutsuki who achieved godhood and transcended to another plane. He defines shinjutsu as divine abilities more powerful than ninjutsu which can only be used by gods, including the Karma. Meanwhile, Momoshiki appears in Boruto's mind, showing him a vision of his friends fighting him. Kawaki, having deduced that Boruto, being a full-fledged Otsutsuki, is likely to turn evil, sends Naruto and Hinata into another dimension, vowing to kill Boruto and all other Otsutsukis. Boruto confronts Kawaki, and in the ensuing fight, Kawaki slashes out Boruto's right eye. Sasuke arrives and tries to stop Kawaki, but the latter manages to escape. Kawaki meets with Eida, who uses her Senrigan dojutsu to rewrite everyone's memory: Kawaki and Boruto will have swapped places. Only Sumire Kakei and Sarada are immune, with the latter awakening her Mangekyou Sharingan. Sarada is able to convince Sasuke of Boruto's innocence, with Sasuke swearing to protect Boruto.
